They must develop a fundamental understanding of how cells develop, including mechanisms, molecular machinery, dynamics, and cell-cell interactions, and use this understanding to manipulate cells purposefully. Investigators can choose any undifferentiated cell type, from any animal species, as a starting point and choose any appropriate functional product (cell, organoid, etc.) with real-world relevance. This solicitation parallels NSF’s investment in Understanding the Rules of Life (URoL): Predicting Phenotype, NSF’s Big Idea focused on predicting the set of observable characteristics (phenotype) of an organism based on its genetic makeup and the nature of its environment and applies it to understanding and accomplishing the intentional and guided differentiation of an undifferentiated cell into cells, organoids or tissues with predetermined activities and functions."

The present electric power grid, an ad hoc system, experiences blackouts over large regions, tripped by minor events that escalate with surprising speed into widespread power failures.  This illustrates the limitations of the current science and technology, which do not enable us to conceptualize and design for the deep interdependencies among engineered systems and the natural world.  At the same time, pressure to develop technologies such as renewable energy, wireless health, advanced manufacturing, smart materials, and electrified ground and air vehicles creates an unprecedented opportunity to rethink many important classes of systems.The goal of the CPS program is to develop the core system science needed to engineer complex cyber-physical systems upon which people can depend with high confidence. The program aims to foster a research community committed to advancing research and education in CPS and to transitioning CPS science and technology into engineering practice. By abstracting from the particulars of specific systems and application domains, the CPS program aims to reveal cross-cutting fundamental scientific and engineering principles that underpin the integration of cyber and physical elements across all application sectors.  To expedite and accelerate the realization of cyber-physical systems in a wide range of applications, the CPS program also supports the development of methods, tools, and hardware and software components based upon these cross-cutting principles, along with validation of the principles via prototypes and test beds.Three types of research and education projects will be considered, which differ in scope and goals:Breakthrough projects must offer a significant advance in fundamental CPS science, engineering and/or technology that has the potential to change the field.  Funding for Breakthrough projects may be requested for a total of  up to $750,000 for a period of up to 3 years.Synergy projects must demonstrate innovation at the intersection of multiple disciplines, to accomplish a clear goal that requires an integrated perspective spanning the disciplines.  Funding for Synergy projects may be requested for a total of $750,001 to $2,000,000 for a period of 3 to 4 years.Frontiers projects must address clearly identified critical CPS challenges that cannot be achieved by a set of smaller projects.  Funding may be requested for a total of $1,200,000 to $10,000,000 for a period of 4 to 5 years.  Note that, due to the difference in goals and scope, the range for Frontiers projects overlaps with the range for Synergy projects.The CPS program is cooperating with other government agencies to support cyber-physical systems research that is relevant to their missions. Dear Colleague Letters will announce these opportunities as they arise.A more complete description of the CPS program is provided in Section II, Program Description, of this solicitation."

CCIs that address these challenges will produce transformative research, lead to innovation, and attract broad scientific and public interest. CCIs are agile structures that can respond rapidly to emerging opportunities and make full use of cyberinfrastructure to enhance collaborations. CCIs may partner with researchers from industry, government laboratories and international organizations. CCIs integrate research, innovation, education, and public outreach and include a plan to broaden participation of underrepresented groups. The CCI program is a two-phase program. Both phases are described in this solicitation. Phase I CCIs receive significant resources to develop the science and integrative elements of a CCI before requesting Phase II funding. Phase I proposals funded in FY 2012 will seek Phase II funding in FY 2015. Only organizations receiving Phase I awards in FY2009 are eligible to request Phase II funding in FY 2012.For the FY 2012 Phase I competition, only projects addressing the theme of sustainable chemistry will be considered. The preliminary proposal and proposal must address how the topic addresses sustainable chemistry. Areas of focus include but are not limited to 1. Developing clean, safe, and economical alternatives to traditional chemical products and practices.2. Exploring alternatives to petroleum as a source of feedstock chemicals, including biorenewables. 3. Exploring earth-abundant, inexpensive and benign alternatives to rare, expensive and toxic chemicals. Examples include indium, germanium, rare earth elements and platinum catalysts.4. Developing efficient recognition/sequestration and recycling of key elements essential for sustainability, for example phosphorus and rare earth elements.Projects involving alternative energy, climate change and other aspects of sustainability are best supported by the SEES solicitations and will not be considered in CCI in FY2012."
